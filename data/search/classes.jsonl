Students evaluate potential solutions to the problem in light of what they found through their research and the potential for increasing social justice.\nLAHS 4116\nIn the second semester, student teams prioritize design and prototyping process, working through difficulties and constraints any potential solution faces, and assessing strengths and weaknesses of proposed solutions in dialogue with their stakeholders. Students prototype potential solutions, whether a technological or process design or proposed policy or legislation, and have their prototype assessed, tested, and critiqued by both the instructor and representatives from the stakeholder group."}
