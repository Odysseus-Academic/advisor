a:T5b6,Architectural design principles, technical concepts, applications, and measures of quality. Ongoing development of key professional skills such as modes of inquiry, problem structuring, drawing and modeling, workflows, and critique. Site, program, structural, regulatory, and environmental influences addressed in architectural formulations. Development of independent interests, research pursuits, and modes of working. 3015: Various materials and techniques of building design. The technical language of describing designed structures. Human experience, health & wellness, user needs, and regulatory standards in the built environment at multiple scales. Analysis of programmatic and site variables that influence design decisions and resource and environmental stewardship objectives. How fundamental design concepts (idea, movement, structure) and human occupation (context, program, experience) intersect with technical constructive knowledges (assembly, materials, building systems). Subjective
measures of quality in design. 3016: Continued studies in materials and techniques of building design. Building assemblies documented in technical
drawing, modeling, and writing. Interweaving of fundamental design concepts, human occupation, and technical constructive knowledges. How subjective and measurable (resource, environmental stewardship) criteria impact design decisions. Hybrid Lecture (2H, 2C), Lab (12L, 4C), Design Lab/Studio (2L, 1C) (2H,14L,7C)b:T418,Team oriented, open-ended, multi-disciplinary design projects focused on industrially relevant problems. A specific, complex engineering design problem taken from problem definition to product realization and testing. Emphasis on documenting and reporting technical work. Making informed judgments which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. 4015: Problem identification, including consideration of public health and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors and constraints; idea generation and concept selection; application of design, test, and analysis tools developed in previous courses; ethical and professional responsibilities; verification and validation; communication and working in teams. 4016: Project management; working on teams, analysis and optimization, fabrication and testing, and communicating technical ideas.
