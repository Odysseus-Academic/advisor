a:T421,Principles that provide the foundation for the design and application of process-oriented efficiency and productivity performance measurement and management systems. Links between the efficiency/productivity measurement literature, systems thinking, and socio-technical systems. A focus on benchmarking (assessing) current productivity/efficiency levels, identifying peers, defining performance targets, planning (designing) future efficiency and productivity interventions, and linkages between efficiency/productivity with profitability. Modeling approaches of efficiency and productivity measurement covered include: index numbers, optimization approaches such as data envelopment analysis (DEA), statistical approaches such as statistical frontier analysis (SFA), fuzzy set approaches, and dynamic modeling approaches such as system dynamics. Concepts demonstrated by completing a research project requiring translating basic tenets of efficiency/productivity measurement literature into practice by analyzing empirical datasets.
