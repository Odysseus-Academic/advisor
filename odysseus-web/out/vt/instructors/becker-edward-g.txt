Development of independent interests, research pursuits, and modes of working. 3015: Various materials and techniques of building design. The technical language of describing designed structures. Human experience, health & wellness, user needs, and regulatory standards in the built environment at multiple scales. Analysis of programmatic and site variables that influence design decisions and resource and environmental stewardship objectives. How fundamental design concepts (idea, movement, structure) and human occupation (context, program, experience) intersect with technical constructive knowledges (assembly, materials, building systems). Subjective
measures of quality in design. 3016: Continued studies in materials and techniques of building design. Building assemblies documented in technical
drawing, modeling, and writing. Interweaving of fundamental design concepts, human occupation, and technical constructive knowledges.
