a:T406,1225-1226: CALCULUS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE Quantitative and computational thinking to address relevant intercultural and global issues. Unified calculus course covering techniques of differential and integral calculus for functions of one variable. Constitutes the standard first-year mathematics courses for science and engineering. 1225: limits, continuity, differentiation, transcendental functions, applications of differentiation, introduction to integration. Assumes 2 units of high school algebra, 1 unit of geometry, 1/2 unit each of trigonometry and precalculus, and placement by Math Dept. 1226: techniques and applications of integration, trapezoidal and Simpson’s rules, improper integrals, sequences and series, power series, parametric curves and polar coordinates, software-based techniques. A student can earn credit for at most one of 1025 and 1225. A student can earn credit for at most one of 1525 and 1225. A student can earn credit for at most one of 1026 and 1226.
