a:T73a,Introduction to the theory and practice of architecture. Discipline-specific investigations into how architecture concentrates and conveys natural and cultural influences. Focus on building design as a comprehensive activity balancing numerous concerns including aesthetic, history, materiality, tectonics, and spatial expression. Examination of the relationship between the built and natural environments, including the effects of construction and environmental factors. Qualitative approaches to how architecture contributes to human wellbeing. Identification of relevant areas of interest and modes of inquiry to enrich current work and serve as a basis for self-directed learning. Immersion in the design laboratory ('studio') learning environment. 2015: How architecture concentrates and expresses natural and cultural influences, as well as how it addresses the well-being of individuals and society, through design investigations of varied scales and complexity. Identifying and connecting the fundamentals that comprise the multidimensional wholeness of a work of architecture. Selecting, describing, and analyzing relevant precedents. How architecture and the arts are similar and different, as well as how different fields of knowledge relate to architecture as a cultural and technological production. Discipline-specific
modes of communication. 2016: Continued exploration of the dynamic between built and natural environments, including site, environmental forces, and construction impacts; how architecture contributes to human wellbeing. Speculation, development, and communication of architectural proposals. Developing creative source materials by examining a problem from various disciplinary and cultural perspectives. Increasingly complex design work.
