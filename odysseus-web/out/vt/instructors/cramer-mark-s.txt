The basic ideas will be illustrated by and applied to problems in continuum mechanics, solid and fluid mechanics, rigid body dynamics, and electromagnetic theory.","pathways":"","hours":"3 credits","groupId":3735,"sections":[{"id":"2009;09;92921","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":92921,"enrollment":14,"gpa":3.98,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2009,"gradeData":[100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2013;09;93282","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":93282,"enrollment":20,"gpa":3.94,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2013,"gradeData":[95,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2012;09;93145","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":93145,"enrollment":21,"gpa":3.92,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2012,"gradeData":[90.5,0,4.8,4.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2014;09;83334","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":83334,"enrollment":10,"gpa":3.9,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2014,"gradeData":[80,10,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2005;09;95369","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":95369,"enrollment":11,"gpa":3.8,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2005,"gradeData":[90.9,0,0,9.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2008;09;92908","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":92908,"enrollment":11,"gpa":3.97,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2008,"gradeData":[100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2015;09;83385","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":83385,"enrollment":12,"gpa":4,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2015,"gradeData":[100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2006;09;92757","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":92757,"enrollment":13,"gpa":3.89,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2006,"gradeData":[84.6,0,0,15.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2007;09;92756","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":92756,"enrollment":13,"gpa":3.98,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2007,"gradeData":[100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2010;09;93020","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":93020,"enrollment":13,"gpa":3.95,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2010,"gradeData":[92.29999999999998,0,7.700000000000001,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2018;09;84378","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":84378,"enrollment":5,"gpa":4,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2018,"gradeData":[100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2016;09;83953","instructorName":"cramer-mark-s","course_id":"ESM-6714","credits":"  3","crn":83953,"enrollment":7,"gpa":3.67,"term":"Fall","title":"Applied Tensor Analysis","year":2016,"gradeData":[57.1,14.3,0,28.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}]}]}}]
