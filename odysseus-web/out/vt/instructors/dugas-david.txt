a:T5a6,1115: An immersive, interactive course focused on inquiry, experimentation, discovery, and synthesis.  Employs a series of iterative drawing and modeling exercises, at a beginners level, in two and three dimensions across multiple scales. Develops self-reliance and self-critique, which opens intellectual horizons. Challenges expand and deepen aesthetic judgment and critical understanding. Develops fundamental thinking and making skills that advance their abilities to solve problems by exploring strategies toward viable consequences. Restricted to students transferring into the School of Architecture + Design and changing their major to architecture, landscape architecture, interior design, or industrial design. 1116: An immersive, interactive course focused on inquiry, experimentation, discovery, and synthesis.

Identifying and connecting the fundamentals that comprise the multidimensional wholeness of a work of architecture. Selecting, describing, and analyzing relevant precedents. How architecture and the arts are similar and different, as well as how different fields of knowledge relate to architecture as a cultural and technological production. Discipline-specific
modes of communication. 2016: Continued exploration of the dynamic between built and natural environments, including site, environmental forces, and construction impacts; how architecture contributes to human wellbeing. Speculation, development, and communication of architectural proposals. Developing creative source materials by examining a problem from various disciplinary and cultural perspectives.
