Experimental data from several disciplines (e.g., genetics, physiology, biochemistry) are reviewed to demonstrate their associations with behavioral adaptive mechanisms.  Avian and mammalian species living in wild, zoo, agricultural companion and laboratory settings are discussed.","pathways":"","hours":"3 credits","groupId":1226,"sections":[{"id":"2005;01;10808","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  2","crn":10808,"enrollment":70,"gpa":3.27,"term":"Spring","title":"Soc Behav Anim","year":2005,"gradeData":[41.4,0,0,50,0,0,8.6,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2017;01;11286","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  3","crn":11286,"enrollment":50,"gpa":3.01,"term":"Spring","title":"Social Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2017,"gradeData":[16,10,8,32,16,6,6,2,4,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2016;01;11242","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  3","crn":11242,"enrollment":62,"gpa":3.14,"term":"Spring","title":"Social Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2016,"gradeData":[11.3,17.7,25.8,24.2,9.7,6.5,0,1.6,1.6,0,0,1.6,0]},{"id":"2011;01;11095","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  3","crn":11095,"enrollment":114,"gpa":3.41,"term":"Spring","title":"Social Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2011,"gradeData":[34.2,17.5,10.5,20.2,11.4,2.6,3.5,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2015;01;11163","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  3","crn":11163,"enrollment":77,"gpa":3.21,"term":"Spring","title":"Social Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2015,"gradeData":[13,23.4,16.9,24.7,13,3.9,2.6,1.3,1.3,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2013;01;11125","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  3","crn":11125,"enrollment":87,"gpa":3.12,"term":"Spring","title":"Social Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2013,"gradeData":[16.1,18.4,6.9,35.6,8,6.9,3.4,2.3,0,1.1,0,1.1,0]},{"id":"2012;01;11120","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  3","crn":11120,"enrollment":88,"gpa":3.25,"term":"Spring","title":"Social Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2012,"gradeData":[17,27.3,6.8,27.3,14.8,2.3,2.3,1.1,0,0,0,1.1,0]},{"id":"2008;01;16449","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  3","crn":16449,"enrollment":95,"gpa":3.35,"term":"Spring","title":"Social Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2008,"gradeData":[50.5,0,0,41.1,0,0,8.4,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2010;01;11032","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  3","crn":11032,"enrollment":131,"gpa":3.2,"term":"Spring","title":"Social Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2010,"gradeData":[17.56488549618321,16.0763358778626,19.84732824427481,25.20610687022901,13,1.488549618320611,2.282442748091603,1.488549618320611,0,1.488549618320611,0,0.7938931297709924,0.7633587786259542]},{"id":"2014;01;11147","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  3","crn":11147,"enrollment":52,"gpa":3.28,"term":"Spring","title":"Social Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2014,"gradeData":[13.5,34.6,13.5,19.2,7.700000000000001,7.700000000000001,1.9,0,0,1.9,0,0,0]},{"id":"2009;01;10997","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4574","credits":"  3","crn":10997,"enrollment":99,"gpa":3.21,"term":"Spring","title":"Social Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2009,"gradeData":[42.39999999999999,0,0,44.39999999999999,0,0,11.1,0,0,2,0,0,0]}]},{"id":"BIOL-4984","subject":"BIOL","code":"4984","level":4,"title":"Special Study","coreqs":"","repeatability":"","description":"","pathways":"","hours":"1-19 credits","groupId":1241,"sections":[{"id":"2007;01;16725","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4984","credits":"  3","crn":16725,"enrollment":38,"gpa":3.53,"term":"Spring","title":"SS:Soc Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2007,"gradeData":[52.6,0,0,42.1,0,0,5.3,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2006;01;16182","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"BIOL-4984","credits":"  3","crn":16182,"enrollment":44,"gpa":3.59,"term":"Spring","title":"SS:Soc Behav Birds & Mammals","year":2006,"gradeData":[72.7,0,0,20.5,0,0,6.8,0,0,0,0,0,0]}]},{"id":"FIW-4994","subject":"FIW","code":"4994","level":4,"title":"Undergraduate Research","coreqs":"","repeatability":"","description":"","pathways":"","hours":"1-19 credits","groupId":3888,"sections":[{"id":"2015;01;13567","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"FIW-4994","credits":"  1","crn":13567,"enrollment":9,"gpa":3.9,"term":"Spring","title":"Undergraduate Research","year":2015,"gradeData":[88.9,0,11.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2010;01;13085","instructorName":"dunnington-elizabeth-a","course_id":"FIW-4994","credits":"  1","crn":13085,"enrollment":18,"gpa":3.87,"term":"Spring","title":"Undergraduate Research","year":2010,"gradeData":[77.8,5.6,0,16.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}]}]}}]
