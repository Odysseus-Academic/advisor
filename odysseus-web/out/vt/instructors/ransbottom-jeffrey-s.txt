a:T47f,Industry-like two-semester, team-based major design experience applying knowledge and skills acquired in previous coursework. Design and implement solutions to meet multiple realistic constraints; design to incorporate appropriate engineering standards. A specific, complex engineering design problem is taken from problem definition to product realization and testing. Within the design process, topics include written/oral communication, discourse, ethical reasoning, professional development, project management, and working within a team. 4805: Identify, formulate, and define engineering problem. Generate and select design alternatives. Apply design and analysis methods, from previous courses, to develop, evaluate, and communicate detailed project design. 4806: Implement and refine project design from ECE 4805. Test, analyze, document, and deliver the resulting project outcomes.
