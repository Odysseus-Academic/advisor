a:T541,First year of military science. MS 1005: Introduction to the Army introduces the personal challenges and competencies that are critical for effective leadership and communication. Student learning focuses on developing individual and interactive skills. Students learn how cultural understanding, goal setting, time management, stress management, and comprehensive fitness relates to leadership and the Army profession. Students further learn the ROTC course structure and progression, and are immersed into Army organizational culture via classroom instruction, physical fitness training, and leadership labs. MS 1006: Foundations of Agile and Adaptive Leadership introduces students to basic knowledge required to be a successful member of a military team, to include the U.S. Armys mission, its role and relationship in the American governance system, U.S. military customs and courtesies, operational terms and graphics, map reading, land navigation squad tactics, the Army Values and Warrior Ethos. This course includes reading assignments, homework assignments, practical exercises, a mid-term exam, and a final exam. Students receive systematic and specific feedback on leader attributes, values, and core leader competencies throughout the course. Successful completion of this course will help prepare cadets for Military Sci II, AROTC.2:["$","$L9",null,{"instructor":{"id":"cooper-richard-f","firstName":"Richard F","lastName":"Cooper","difficulty":5.6,"rating":9.5,"recommendedPct":100,"numRatings":2,"sectionsTaught":576,"courses":[{"id":"ECE-1004","subject":"ECE","code":"1004","level":1,"title":"Introduction to ECE Concepts","coreqs":"","repeatability":"","description":"Introduction to topics that span the field of electrical and computer engineering (ECE).
