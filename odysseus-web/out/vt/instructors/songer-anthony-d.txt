a:T571,With the acceleration of the process of global revolution in science, engineering and technology led by information technology, the human society is in a gradual transition from an industrial society into an information society. As a new productivity with the greatest potential at the present age, information technology has undergone great development. The incessant innovation in technology has also urged people to make better use of it and apply advanced information technology to their own industry. In recent years, Information Technology (IT) and Cyber Infrastructure has been transforming engineering and business practices in many sectors, resulting in efficiency gains and improved services for the client. The infrastructure industry has been slow to utilize information technology effectively and slower still to grasp the ways in which the multitude of design, calculation, specification, project management, asset management, sensor technology, database and data analysis software applications relate to each other. This course provides an overview of the range of Information Technology (IT) applications available to the civil and environmental professional throughout the life cycle of a project, from data collection and analysis through software, project management, environmental impact analysis, visualization, and infrastructure asset management.
