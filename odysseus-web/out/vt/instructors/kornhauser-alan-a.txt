Flow processes: volumetric efficiency, intake and exhaust tuning, two-stroke scavenging, carburetion, fuel injection, super- and turbo-charging.","pathways":"","hours":"3 credits","groupId":5878,"sections":[{"id":"2009;09;94134","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":94134,"enrollment":8,"gpa":3.09,"term":"Fall","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2009,"gradeData":[50,0,0,12.5,0,0,37.5,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2010;09;94267","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":94267,"enrollment":20,"gpa":2.97,"term":"Fall","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2010,"gradeData":[5.04,19.98,15.03,5.04,19.98,15.03,9.989999999999998,0,0,0,0,0,10]},{"id":"2008;09;96567","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":96567,"enrollment":21,"gpa":2.89,"term":"Fall","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2008,"gradeData":[28.6,0,0,38.1,0,0,28.6,0,0,0,0,4.8,0]},{"id":"2014;01;14809","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":14809,"enrollment":22,"gpa":3.11,"term":"Spring","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2014,"gradeData":[22.71818181818182,18.13636363636364,4.581818181818182,13.65,9.068181818181818,13.65,13.65,0,0,0,0,0,4.545454545454546]},{"id":"2008;01;17015","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":17015,"enrollment":34,"gpa":3.13,"term":"Spring","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2008,"gradeData":[38.2,0,0,44.1,0,0,11.8,0,0,5.9,0,0,0]},{"id":"2016;01;15547","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":15547,"enrollment":38,"gpa":2.99,"term":"Spring","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2016,"gradeData":[10.5,15.75,10.5,13.17105263157895,21.09210526315789,15.75,2.671052631578947,0,0,0,2.671052631578947,0,7.894736842105263]},{"id":"2018;01;15873","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":15873,"enrollment":41,"gpa":3.15,"term":"Spring","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2018,"gradeData":[19.5,12.17560975609756,17.02682926829268,14.64878048780488,17.02682926829268,9.797560975609757,2.473170731707317,0,2.473170731707317,0,0,0,4.878048780487805]},{"id":"2005;09;93765","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":93765,"enrollment":40,"gpa":2.73,"term":"Fall","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2005,"gradeData":[22.5,0,0,42.5,0,0,30,0,0,2.5,0,2.5,0]},{"id":"2015;01;14823","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":14823,"enrollment":24,"gpa":3.09,"term":"Spring","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2015,"gradeData":[4.125,20.80833333333333,20.80833333333333,20.80833333333333,8.341666666666667,8.341666666666667,8.341666666666667,0,0,0,0,0,8.333333333333334]},{"id":"2014;01;20054","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":20054,"enrollment":23,"gpa":2.92,"term":"Spring","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2014,"gradeData":[4.3,26.1,8.7,13,17.4,8.7,21.7,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2011;09;94418","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":94418,"enrollment":24,"gpa":2.84,"term":"Fall","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2011,"gradeData":[20.8,8.3,8.3,16.7,12.5,12.5,4.2,12.5,0,0,0,4.2,0]},{"id":"2015;01;14822","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":14822,"enrollment":24,"gpa":3.16,"term":"Spring","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2015,"gradeData":[16.7,20.8,20.8,12.5,4.2,16.7,8.3,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2017;01;15635","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":15635,"enrollment":25,"gpa":3.09,"term":"Spring","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2017,"gradeData":[7.968000000000001,28.032,7.968000000000001,16.032,16.032,12,7.968000000000001,0,0,0,0,0,4]},{"id":"2013;01;17746","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":17746,"enrollment":26,"gpa":3.2,"term":"Spring","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2013,"gradeData":[23.1,11.5,23.1,19.2,7.700000000000001,3.8,7.700000000000001,3.8,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"2004;09;93523","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":93523,"enrollment":32,"gpa":3.07,"term":"Fall","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2004,"gradeData":[34.4,0,0,46.9,0,0,9.4,0,0,6.3,0,3.1,0]},{"id":"2006;09;93914","instructorName":"kornhauser-alan-a","course_id":"ME-4204","credits":"  3","crn":93914,"enrollment":33,"gpa":3.07,"term":"Fall","title":"Internal Combustion Engines","year":2006,"gradeData":[42.4,0,0,39.4,0,0,12.1,0,0,0,0,6.1,0]}]}]}}]
