a:T40e,Introduction to the major scientific models of decision making and applications to real-life situations. Economic models highlighting optimal choices and psychological models highlighting decision making tendencies. 2005: Emphasis on individual decision making in non-strategic choice settings. Probabilistic reasoning and economic model of rationality. Violations of the rational choice model, and psychological, physiological, and statistical models that accommodate this behavior. Applications to social settings and longer periods of time. Common ethical dilemmas and making ethical choices as an individual. 2006: Individual decision making in interactive and strategic choice settings as well as group decision making. Simultaneous, sequential, dynamic, repeated, and incomplete information games. Preferences for fairness, reciprocity, and cultural differences in interactions. Limitations when making group decisions. Ethical reasoning and computational analysis of strategy. Applications to voting,
negotiations, and cooperation.2:["$","$L9",null,{"instructor":{"id":"smith-alexander-c","firstName":"Alexander C","lastName":"Smith","difficulty":-1,"rating":-1,"recommendedPct":-1,"numRatings":0,"sectionsTaught":20,"courses":[{"id":"BDS-2005","subject":"BDS","code":"2005","level":2,"title":"Fundamentals of Behavioral Decision Science","coreqs":"","repeatability":"","description":"$a","pathways":" 3 Reasoning in Social Sciences, 10 Ethical Reasoning","hours":"3 credits","groupId":1130,"sections":[{"id":"2023;09;81599","instructorName":"smith-alexander-c","course_id":"BDS-2005","credits":"  3","crn":81599,"enrollment":77,"gpa":3.14,"term":"Fall","title":"Fundamentals of BDS","year":2023,"gradeData":[18.2025974025974,12.98831168831169,20.76233766233766,12.98831168831169,14.31558441558441,7.774025974025973,5.214285714285714,1.327272727272727,0,0,0,1.327272727272727,5.194805194805195]}]},{"id":"ECON-3254","subject":"ECON","code":"3254","level":3,"title":"Analysis of Economic Data","coreqs":"","repeatability":"","description":"Sources of economic data.
