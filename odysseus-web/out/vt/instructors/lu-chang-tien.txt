a:T5a3,5525: Basic techniques in data analytics including the preparation and manipulation of data for analysis and the creation of data files from multiple and dissimilar sources. The data mining and knowledge discovery process. Overview of data mining algorithms in classification, clustering, association analysis, probabilistic modeling, and matrix decompositions. Detailed study of classification methods including tree-based methods, Bayesian methods, logistic regression, ensemble, bagging and boosting methods, neural network methods, use of support vectors and Bayesian networks. Detailed study of clustering methods including k-means, hierarchical and self-organizing map methods. Prerequisite: Graduate Standing required.
5526: Techniques in unsupervised and visualized learning in high dimension spaces. Theoretical, probabilistic, and applied aspects of data analytics. Methods include generalized linear models in high dimensional spaces, regularization, lasso and related methods, principal component regression (pca), tree methods, and random forests. Clustering methods including k-means, hierarchical clustering, biclustering, and model-based clustering will be thoroughly examined. Distance-based learning methods include multi dimensional scaling, the self organizing map, graphical/network models, and isomap. Supervised learning will consist of discriminant analyses, supervised pca, support vector machines, and kernel methods.2:["$","$L9",null,{"instructor":{"id":"lu-chang-tien","firstName":"Chang Tien","lastName":"Lu","difficulty":-1,"rating":-1,"recommendedPct":-1,"numRatings":0,"sectionsTaught":32,"courses":[{"id":"CS-5024","subject":"CS","code":"5024","level":5,"title":"Ethics and Professionalism in Computer Science","coreqs":"","repeatability":"","description":"Ethical implications and consequences of computing technology applied to algorithmic decision making, security, privacy, autonomous systems.
