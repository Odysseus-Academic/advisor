We will examine the deliberate and systematic attempt to annihilate the Jewish people by the National Socialist German State during World War II. Although Jews were the primary victims, Gypsies, people with disabilities, homosexuals, Jehovahs Witnesses and political dissidents were targeted; we will discuss their fate as well.  The class will be organized around the examination of primary sources: written accounts, photographic and film, personal testimony.","pathways":"","hours":"3 credits","groupId":5506,"sections":[{"id":"2021;09;91191","instructorName":"narayanan-anndal","course_id":"JUD-3494","credits":"  3","crn":91191,"enrollment":5,"gpa":3.88,"term":"Fall","title":"The Holocaust","year":2021,"gradeData":[60,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}]}]}}]
