The data mining and knowledge discovery process. Overview of data mining algorithms in classification, clustering, association analysis, probabilistic modeling, and matrix decompositions. Detailed study of classification methods including tree-based methods, Bayesian methods, logistic regression, ensemble, bagging and boosting methods, neural network methods, use of support vectors and Bayesian networks. Detailed study of clustering methods including k-means, hierarchical and self-organizing map methods. Prerequisite: Graduate Standing required.
5526: Techniques in unsupervised and visualized learning in high dimension spaces. Theoretical, probabilistic, and applied aspects of data analytics. Methods include generalized linear models in high dimensional spaces, regularization, lasso and related methods, principal component regression (pca), tree methods, and random forests. Clustering methods including k-means, hierarchical clustering, biclustering, and model-based clustering will be thoroughly examined. Distance-based learning methods include multi dimensional scaling, the self organizing map, graphical/network models, and isomap. Supervised learning will consist of discriminant analyses, supervised pca, support vector machines, and kernel methods.2:["$","$L9",null,{"instructor":{"id":"karpatne-anuj","firstName":"Anuj","lastName":"Karpatne","difficulty":6.6,"rating":8.8,"recommendedPct":75,"numRatings":4,"sectionsTaught":16,"courses":[{"id":"CS-4664","subject":"CS","code":"4664","level":4,"title":"Data-Centric Computing Capstone","coreqs":"","repeatability":"","description":"Advanced, project-based course on deriving valuable insights from real-world data collected from a variety of sources.
