a:T47f,Industry-like two-semester, team-based major design experience applying knowledge and skills acquired in previous coursework. Design and implement solutions to meet multiple realistic constraints; design to incorporate appropriate engineering standards. A specific, complex engineering design problem is taken from problem definition to product realization and testing. Within the design process, topics include written/oral communication, discourse, ethical reasoning, professional development, project management, and working within a team. 4805: Identify, formulate, and define engineering problem. Generate and select design alternatives. Apply design and analysis methods, from previous courses, to develop, evaluate, and communicate detailed project design. 4806: Implement and refine project design from ECE 4805. Test, analyze, document, and deliver the resulting project outcomes. Pre: 2804 (C-), (12 credit hours of C- or better within their declared disciplinary major) or (9 credit hours of C- or better within their declared disciplinary major and 3 credit hours of C- or better within their secondary focus) for 4805; 4805 (C-) for 4806.2:["$","$L9",null,{"instructor":{"id":"odendaal-willem-g","firstName":"Willem G","lastName":"Odendaal","difficulty":1.1,"rating":2.1,"recommendedPct":-1,"numRatings":1,"sectionsTaught":45,"courses":[{"id":"ECE-2054","subject":"ECE","code":"2054","level":2,"title":"Applied Electrical Theory","coreqs":"MATH-2214","repeatability":"","description":"For students in the Mechanical Engineering program or by permission of the ECE Department.
