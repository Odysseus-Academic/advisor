a:T418,Team oriented, open-ended, multi-disciplinary design projects focused on industrially relevant problems. A specific, complex engineering design problem taken from problem definition to product realization and testing. Emphasis on documenting and reporting technical work. Making informed judgments which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. 4015: Problem identification, including consideration of public health and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors and constraints; idea generation and concept selection; application of design, test, and analysis tools developed in previous courses; ethical and professional responsibilities; verification and validation; communication and working in teams. 4016: Project management; working on teams, analysis and optimization, fabrication and testing, and communicating technical ideas.
