d:T69e,The purpose of this four-week elective is to allow the student to broaden their medical knowledge through intensive one-to-one Spanish instruction in Peru. Since 2011, Medical Electives Network has offered medical electives, including a CME accredited medical Spanish program, in Trujillo and other sites around Peru. The Medical Electives Network was established to provide health and medical education as well as health care Spanish skills in Peru. Elective rotations take place at both government hospitals and Non-Governmental Organizations(NGO) facilities. Conditions at the hospitals vary according to the resources available. Students will experience health care in a developing country, and see conditions they may not see in the United States. In addition to their clinical work, students will develop their general and medical Spanish skills. Classes are taught at all levels and beginner Spanish speakers have the option of taking an intensive medical Spanish program, which offers an additional 2 hours each morning for the first week or two before beginning the clinical rotation. This provides an opportunity to build language skills before beginning clinic. The Medical Electives Network program also provides 2-3 community health fairs per month, where students will spend the day in a public location helping provide free consultations and medical treatment to patients. Community partners for these events include local municipalities, the national police and the prison service. Other outreach opportunities include week-long surgical missions (2-3 per year) and volunteering at an orphanage or senior program.
