d:T4c8,The Academic Medicine Leadership elective provides medical students an opportunity to engage in and learn core principles of academic medicine and leadership. This longitudinal elective (equivalent to a two-week elective, minimum 30 hours) will provide individuals the opportunity to actively engage in the change management process of the medical school by working directly with leaders who are responsible for leading change within the education mission of VTCSOM. Participants will learn through several methods: (1) participating in an observing strategic planning meetings related to curricular reform, (2) contributing to the development of strategic planning workshop design and data collection, (3) attending meetings with the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education to synthesize findings and explore questions related to change management in medical education, (4) attending meetings with other senior leadership at VTCSOM who are involved in the change process, and, (5) designing and completing a final reflection project that integrates lessons learned with influence on future career. All VTCSOM Electives - 40 contact hours = 1 credit. Since this is a 2-week elective, they would receive 2 credits. 2O, 2C12:T4c8,The Academic Medicine Leadership elective provides medical students an opportunity to engage in and learn core principles of academic medicine and leadership.
