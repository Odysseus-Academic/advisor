d:T410,To introduce medical students to a more rural population of individuals with a wide variety of Emergency Department presentations, as well as, to become familiar with a different hospital system in this more rural setting. It will be expected that the medical students will further develop their skills of history taking, physical examination, critical thinking and knowledge of emergency room medicine, including pharmacology, while becoming competent and confident in the diagnosis and management of these issues. This elective is to assist the student in understanding the type of care that can be offered in a rural setting. More specifically, the student will see the contrast in the rural and urban setting in managing patients in terms of onsite specialists, onsite medical equipment, and onsite ancillary services. The student will learn that these limited resources may determine the need to transfer the patient to a higher level of care in an urban medical center where their core Emergency Medicine clerkship has been completed.12:T410,To introduce medical students to a more rural population of individuals with a wide variety of Emergency Department presentations, as well as, to become familiar with a different hospital system in this more rural setting.
