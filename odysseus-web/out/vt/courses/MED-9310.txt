d:T5ce,The fourth-year medical student who takes this elective will be immersed in a busy inpatient cardiology service with exposure to a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases including acute coronary syndromes, valvular heart diseases, cardiomyopathies and common dysrhythmias. The student will also help manage an outpatient cardiology observation unit. Most patients in the observation unit will be low-risk patients with chest pain or those with heart failure exacerbations. Chest pain patients will be ruled out for myocardial necrosis, then undergo appropriate non-invasive studies such as exercise treadmill testing, exercise or dobutamine stress echocardiography, nuclear cardiology study (e.g. Lexiscan), or cardiac computed tomographic angiography study. The Acting Intern (AI) will be involved in deciding the most appropriate non-invasive/imaging modality for the patient as well as participate in analyzing the ECG and imaging aspects of the study. Patients with heart failure will be investigated for etiology of HF exacerbation and have appropriate diagnostic studies and adjustment of medical regimens. Some of the patients from the observation unit will be admitted to the AI’s inpatient service. The AI will work closely with the attending, a mid-level provider and with an intern. On most rotations, a cardiology fellow will also be involved in teaching the AI and intern. The preceptor is the inpatient attending and the location is Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital.12:T5ce,The fourth-year medical student who takes this elective will be immersed in a busy inpatient cardiology service with exposure to a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases including acute coronary syndromes, valvular heart diseases, cardiomyopathies and common dysrhythmias.
