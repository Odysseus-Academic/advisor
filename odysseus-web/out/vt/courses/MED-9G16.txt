d:T8de,Students participating in the Immersive Medical Spanish, Costa Rica program will receive four-five hours per day of specific in class lessons in Spanish. The course contains an ideal fusion of pedagogy, language learning, and conversational practice in classroom, simulated, and clinical settings. A pretest is administered to gauge the student’s current Spanish fluency and cater their curriculum to the appropriate level of understanding. Students will receive fluency-appropriate private lessons to master common Spanish vocabulary, terms, and phrases appropriate for conversation in common contexts, such as personal greetings, family, school, hobbies, and food. Students will learn correct gendering of nouns and conjugation of verbs in the past, present, future, and reflexive tenses in addition to correct syntax for asking questions. Students will have supervised practice in integrating vocabulary and language patterns through reading, writing, speaking, and listening in Spanish. Basic out of class experiences, such as visits to local markets and community locations, are used to enhance the student’s conversational ability and provide an engrossing understanding of the Costa Rican language and culture. Weekly evaluations will be performed to monitor the student’s growing proficiency in basic and medical Spanish. Additional weekly class time will be dedicated to teaching specific medical vocabulary as well as practice with simulated and real-life medical situations such as patient interviews and family consultations. The medical component of the classroom curriculum will emphasize medical terminology, patient interviews, and anatomy in Spanish, which are reinforced through mock medical interviews with simulated patients. Further, afternoons are spent performing patient visits and in-clinic patient interactions. Some examples of these activities are: clinical time in a local private clinic, clinical time in a nursing home, participation in community health outreach, medical interviews with local host families, visiting local pharmacies, and riding along with local emergency medical services (EMS) providers. All VTCSOM electives-40 contact hour+1 credit. Since this is a 4 week elective, the student would receive 4 credits.
