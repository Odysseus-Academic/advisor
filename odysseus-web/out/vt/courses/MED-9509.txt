d:T524,This course is designed to raise awareness and highlight opportunities to learn about equitable care in maternal health. The course will also focus on discussing policies at a system level and government/ state level that dictate maternal health care and evaluate the various ways to advocate for our patients. The student will be an added member of the clinical team on Labor and Delivery(performing basic obstetrical skills) during the two-week rotation. The student will participate in all aspects of care including triage, management and clinical-decision making of antepartum and labor and delivery patients. Emphasis will be placed on evaluating each patient’s antepartum course and determinants of health through an equity lens. The student will learn the basics of advocacy as a physician by analyzing current system, local, state, and national policies, and will be able to identify opportunities for advocacy. Students will be required to give one brief presentation at the end of the rotation. The presentation will be a literature review of a pertinent policy, law, or bill of their choice that has a direct impact on maternal health care. There will be no travel necessary. All VTCSOM Electives -40 contact hours=1 credit. Since this is a two week elective, the student will receive 2 credits.(20, 2C)12:T524,This course is designed to raise awareness and highlight opportunities to learn about equitable care in maternal health.
