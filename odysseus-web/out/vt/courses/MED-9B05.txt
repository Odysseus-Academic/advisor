d:T5e0,Physicians routinely rely on tissue diagnoses and clinical laboratory tests to guide patient care. The student will learn the role of anatomic pathology and clinical laboratory medicine in the multidisciplinary care of patients. This course aims to provide a deeper understanding of tissue testing and clinical laboratory test utilization, and how specimens should be submitted. Specifically, every physician needs to know where laboratory tests are performed, limitations, and what pathologists and other laboratory professionals need in order to provide the most meaningful report results for their patients and how to develop a differential diagnosis. Such needs include sample size, adequacy, quality, fixative, and proper type to fit each specific test, as well as knowing what pertinent information should be provided. In this manner, the medical student will know the importance of proper test utilization for which they ultimately one day may be responsible to interpret in the context of the patient’s clinical history, radiologic studies and physical findings. The medical student will also learn how to best consult pathologists, and other laboratory medicine professionals, and discover an amazing resource for collaborative patient care. System cost savings due to decreased laboratory overutilization and improved interdepartmental communication is the goal. All VTCSOM electives -40 contact hours=1 credit. Since this is a two-week elective, the student would receive 2 credits. (2O, 2C)12:T5e0,Physicians routinely rely on tissue diagnoses and clinical laboratory tests to guide patient care.
