A mix of theoretical concepts and numerical algorithms to solve the linear and nonlinear programming problems. 5405 (Linear Programming): Modeling for real world problems using linear programming and integer linear programming. Geometric foundations for linear programs – characterization for polyhedral sets and convex analysis. Numerical algorithms for linear programs: simplex method (its geometry and algebra), primal-dual simplex algorithm, revised simplex, two-phase and big-M methods. Farkas’ Lemma and Optimality Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for linear programs. Duality theory, sensitivity analysis, state-of-the-art modeling language and solvers. 5406 (Nonlinear Programming): Convex analysis and optimization. Fritz John and KKT optimality conditions and numerical algorithms for nonlinear programs. Unconstrained and constrained nonlinear optimization. Convex optimization problems. Numerical methods: Line search methods, steepest descent method, Newton’s method, conjugate directions method, projection gradient method, affine scaling method.
