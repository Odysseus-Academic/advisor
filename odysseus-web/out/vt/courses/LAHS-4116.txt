d:T775,Two-semester experiential learning course sequence, which serves as experiential learning studio course, which serves as culminating capstone experience for the planned Tech for Humanity minor. Immerses students in teams working with stakeholders to identify a sociotechnical problem regarding a technology for which the stakeholder group has less access, awareness, adoption, or benefit compared to the broader population; conduct humanistic and social scientific research to better understand the problem; evaluate different policy and design solutions to the problem and how they contribute to social justice, including enhancing diversity, equity, access, and inclusion; and create a concrete prototype of a solution to the identified problem.
LAHS 4115
In the first semester of the two-course sequence, students work with an external stakeholder partner (e.g., business, nonprofit organization, community group, or government) to identify a pressing sociotechnical problem experienced by the partner or its users, customers, or constituents. Students apply humanistic or social/behavioral scientific research methods (e.g., historical documentary analysis and focus group interviews) to better understand the nature and causes of the problem. Students evaluate potential solutions to the problem in light of what they found through their research and the potential for increasing social justice.
LAHS 4116
In the second semester, student teams prioritize design and prototyping process, working through difficulties and constraints any potential solution faces, and assessing strengths and weaknesses of proposed solutions in dialogue with their stakeholders. Students prototype potential solutions, whether a technological or process design or proposed policy or legislation, and have their prototype assessed, tested, and critiqued by both the instructor and representatives from the stakeholder group.13:T775,Two-semester experiential learning course sequence, which serves as experiential learning studio course, which serves as culminating capstone experience for the planned Tech for Humanity minor.
